## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch sorting algorithms in action, making it easier to understand their behavior.

- **Customization**: Adjust the number of elements to be sorted to explore different scenarios.

- **Real-time Feedback**: Observe comparisons and swaps as they happen in real-time.

- **Audio Feedback**: Enjoy an audio component that adds an extra dimension to the visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- A modern web browser that supports JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualization.git
   ```
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

### Usage
1. Use the slider to set the number of elements you want to sort.

2. Click the "Initialize" button to generate the elements with random values.

3. Click the "Play" button to start the sorting animation. The visualization will showcase the sorting process of the selected algorithm.

4. If you want to pause the animation at any point, click the "Pause" button. Resume the animation by clicking "Play" again.

5. ### Supported Sorting Algorithms
The project currently supports the following sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm known for its simplicity and inefficiency. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

You can easily extend this project to include additional sorting algorithms or more features.
